Karpathy 在斯坦福 CS231n 课程中要求学生用原始 numpy 实现反向传播的各层 forward 和 backward pass。有学生质疑："现实中 TensorFlow 会自动计算，为什么还要学？"

**Karpathy 的回答**：反向传播是一个**泄漏的抽象**（leaky abstraction）。

你不能简单地堆叠任意层然后指望"魔法"帮你优化。以下是一些需要理解反向传播才能 debug 的例子：

1. **sigmoid 梯度消失**：如果权重初始化或数据预处理不当，sigmoid/tanh 会"饱和"，梯度为零，学习完全停滞——loss 不动
2. **死亡的 ReLU**：如果 ReLU 神经元在初始化时对所有数据都输出负值，梯度为 0，这个神经元就"死了"
3. **梯度流异常**：门控单元（如 sigmoid gate）会把梯度乘以接近 0 的值，导致上游梯度被"杀死"

**结论**：如果不理解反向传播，当训练出问题时（并且一定会出问题），你无法有效地 debug。理解反向传播就像理解引用和值类型——不见得天天用，但知道为什么崩溃能省下大量时间。

When we offered [CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) (Deep Learning class) at Stanford, we intentionally designed the programming assignments to include explicit calculations involved in backpropagation on the lowest level. The students had to implement the forward and the backward pass of each layer in raw numpy. Inevitably, some students complained on the class message boards:

> "Why do we have to write the backward pass when frameworks in the real world, such as TensorFlow, compute them for you automatically?"

This is seemingly a perfectly sensible appeal — if you're never going to write backward passes once the class is over, why practice writing them? Are we just torturing the students for our own amusement? Some easy answers could make arguments along the lines of *"it's worth knowing what's under the hood as an intellectual curiosity"*, or perhaps *"you might want to improve on the core algorithm later"*, but there is a much stronger and practical argument, which I wanted to devote a whole post to:

> The problem with Backpropagation is that it is a [leaky abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_abstraction).

In other words, it is easy to fall into the trap of abstracting away the learning process — believing that you can simply stack arbitrary layers together and backprop will "magically make them work" on your data. So lets look at a few explicit examples where this is not the case in quite unintuitive ways.

### Vanishing gradients on sigmoids

We're starting off easy here. At one point it was fashionable to use **sigmoid** (or **tanh**) non-linearities in the fully connected layers. The tricky part people might not realize until they think about the backward pass is that if you are sloppy with the weight initialization or data preprocessing these non-linearities can "saturate" and entirely stop learning — your training loss will be flat and refuse to go down. For example, a fully connected layer with sigmoid non-linearity computes (using raw numpy):

```python
z = 1/(1 + np.exp(-np.dot(W, x))) # forward pass
dx = np.dot(W.T, z*(1-z)) # backward pass: local gradient for x
dW = np.outer(z*(1-z), x) # backward pass: local gradient for W
```

If your weight matrix **W** is initialized too large, the output of the matrix multiply could have a very large range (e.g. numbers between -400 and 400), which will make all outputs in the vector **z** almost binary: either 1 or 0. But if that is the case, **z*(1-z)**, which is local gradient of the sigmoid non-linearity, will in both cases become **zero** ("vanish"), making the gradient for both **x** and **W** be zero. The rest of the backward pass will come out all zero from this point on due to multiplication in the chain rule.

Another non-obvious fun fact about sigmoid is that its local gradient (z*(1-z)) achieves a maximum at 0.25, when z = 0.5. That means that every time the gradient signal flows through a sigmoid gate, its magnitude always diminishes by one quarter (or more). If you're using basic SGD, this would make the lower layers of a network train much slower than the higher ones.

**TLDR**: if you're using **sigmoids** or **tanh** non-linearities in your network and you understand backpropagation you should always be nervous about making sure that the initialization doesn't cause them to be fully saturated.

### Dying ReLUs

Another fun non-linearity is the ReLU, which thresholds neurons at zero from below. The forward and backward pass for a fully connected layer that uses ReLU would at the core include:

```python
z = np.maximum(0, np.dot(W, x)) # forward pass
dW = np.outer(z > 0, x) # backward pass: local gradient for W
```

If you stare at this for a while you'll see that if a neuron gets clamped to zero in the forward pass (i.e. **z** = 0, it doesn't "fire"), then its weights will get zero gradient. This can lead to what is called the "dead ReLU" problem, where if a ReLU neuron is unfortunately initialized such that it never fires, or if a neuron's weights ever get knocked off with a large update during training into this regime, then this neuron will remain permanently dead. It's like permanent, irrecoverable brain damage. Sometimes you can forward the entire training set through a trained network and find that a large fraction (e.g. 40%) of your neurons were zero the entire time.

**TLDR**: If you understand backpropagation and your network has ReLUs, you're always nervous about dead ReLUs. These are neurons that never turn on for any example in your entire training set, and will remain permanently dead. Neurons can also die during training, usually as a symptom of aggressive learning rates.

### Exploding gradients in RNNs

Vanilla RNNs feature another good example of unintuitive effects of backpropagation.

This RNN is unrolled for **T** time steps. When you stare at what the backward pass is doing, you'll see that the gradient signal going backwards in time through all the hidden states is always being multiplied by the same matrix (the recurrence matrix **Whh**), interspersed with non-linearity backprop.

What happens when you take one number **a** and start multiplying it by some other number **b** (i.e. a*b*b*b*b*b*b...)? This sequence either goes to zero if **|b|** < 1, or explodes to infinity when **|b|** > 1. The same thing happens in the backward pass of an RNN, except **b** is a matrix and not just a number, so we have to reason about its largest eigenvalue instead.

**TLDR**: If you understand backpropagation and you're using RNNs you are nervous about having to do gradient clipping, or you prefer to use an LSTM.

### Spotted in the Wild: DQN Clipping

Lets look at one more — the one that actually inspired this post. Yesterday I was browsing for a Deep Q Learning implementation in TensorFlow (to see how others deal with computing the numpy equivalent of **Q[:, a]**, where **a** is an integer vector — turns out this trivial operation is not supported in TF). Anyway, I searched *"dqn tensorflow"*, clicked the first link, and found the core code.

If you're familiar with DQN, you can see that there is the **target_q_t**, which is just **reward * gamma * argmax_a Q(s',a)**, and then there is **q_acted**, which is **Q(s,a)** of the action that was taken. The authors here subtract the two into variable **delta**, which they then want to minimize with the L2 loss with **tf.reduce_mean(tf.square())**.

The problem is that the authors are trying to be robust to outliers, so if the delta is too large, they clip it with **tf.clip_by_value**. This is well-intentioned and looks sensible from the perspective of the forward pass, but it introduces a major bug if you think about the backward pass.

The **clip_by_value** function has a local gradient of zero outside of the range **min_delta** to **max_delta**, so whenever the delta is above min/max_delta, the gradient becomes exactly zero during backprop. The authors are clipping the raw Q delta, when they are likely trying to clip the gradient for added robustness. In that case the correct thing to do is to use the Huber loss in place of **tf.square**:

```python
def clipped_error(x): 
    return tf.select(tf.abs(x) < 1.0, 
                     0.5 * tf.square(x), 
                     tf.abs(x) - 0.5)  # condition, true, false
```

I submitted an [issue](https://github.com/devsisters/DQN-tensorflow/issues/16) on the DQN repo and this was promptly fixed.

### In conclusion

Backpropagation is a leaky abstraction; it is a credit assignment scheme with non-trivial consequences. If you try to ignore how it works under the hood because "TensorFlow automagically makes my networks learn", you will not be ready to wrestle with the dangers it presents, and you will be much less effective at building and debugging neural networks.

The good news is that backpropagation is not that difficult to understand, if presented properly. I have relatively strong feelings on this topic because it seems to me that 95% of backpropagation materials out there present it all wrong, filling pages with mechanical math. Instead, I would recommend the [CS231n lecture on backprop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i94OvYb6noo) which emphasizes intuition. And if you can spare the time, as a bonus, work through the [CS231n assignments](https://cs231n.github.io/), which get you to write backprop manually and help you solidify your understanding.

That's it for now! I hope you'll be much more suspicious of backpropagation going forward and think carefully through what the backward pass is doing.
